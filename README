Hi! This is intended to be a step-by-step tutorial on how to upload material from the Internet to your device.
For this tutorial, we have a games dataset from Kaggle.
You can do a lot of things with this dataset, including problems like DSC10 or skills from other workshops, like from our SciKit/Keras workshop.
Good luck and have fun!
